## How Honeycomb Powers Dash Race

Dash Race is a web3 racing game fully integrated with the Honeycomb Protocol, providing seamless on-chain identity, persistent player stats, and a public leaderboard‚Äîall without managing your own backend.

Player Flow

Guest vs Registered Play:

You can play instantly as a guest (no wallet required), but stats won‚Äôt be saved.

To save your progress and appear on the leaderboard, connect your Solana wallet and register.

Onboarding:

When you click ‚ÄúPlay Game‚Äù with your wallet connected, the app guides you through registration:

Username Entry: You choose your username.

User & Profile Creation: A Honeycomb user and profile are created, all on-chain and owned by your wallet.

(Future) Character Minting: You‚Äôll mint a simple on-chain character (admin-assisted), tracked natively by Honeycomb.

(Future) Resources: ‚ÄúFuel‚Äù (a non-fungible Honeycomb resource) is planned for missions and rewards.

Game Session & Stats:

After every race session, if you click ‚ÄúSave & Exit,‚Äù a modal pops up to let you save your stats (score and miles).

These stats are fetched from Honeycomb, summed with your latest session, and pushed back on-chain‚Äîranking you on the leaderboard.

Leaderboard:

Leaderboard rankings are calculated from Honeycomb profile data‚Äîpublic, transparent, and live.

Missions & Idle Progression (Planned):

Beyond active gameplay, Honeycomb‚Äôs mission pools will allow players to send their characters on ‚Äúidle‚Äù missions (e.g. spend Fuel to earn smaller, passive stats over time). DAO-driven missions will unlock unique NFTs with benefits.

All data (user, profile, character, resources, and mission progress) lives on-chain, managed by Honeycomb. No centralized servers‚Äîeverything is verifiable, upgradable, and composable for future features.
